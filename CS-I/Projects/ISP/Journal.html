    <h2><u>Roles:</u></h2>
    <h4>(Software) Development Engineer:</h4>
    <p>A Software Development Engineer designs, programs, builds, deploys and maintain software by using many different skills and tools in order to accomplish something. Additionally, they help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure those systems remain functional for other people to use.<br><u>Suitability:</u> I feel like I could be a Software Development Engineer since I do like building new stuff,but some challenges I expect to encounter are the code might not work all the time and there could be bugs in the code that prevent the program from running.</p>
    <h4>QA Engineer:</h4>
    <p>QA Engineer stands for Quality Assurance Engineer and their job is to design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures. They document software defects, using a bug tracking system, and report defects to software developers.<br><u>Suitability:</u> I feel like I could be a QA Engineer since I do like to test new stuff and see if it works or not, but some challeneges I expect to encounter are that the test fails and doesn't pass the scenario.</p>
    <h4>Project Manager:</h4>
    <p>A Project Manager deals with the process for leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints. This information usually given and created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints a project manager sets for their team are scope, time, and budget.<br><u>Suitability:</u> I feel like I could be a Project Manager since I do like to create boundaries and constraints for a team in order to get things done for the project, but some chlleneges I expect to encounter is some team members might not meet up to the expectations or they won;t get their work done which can lead to delays. </p>
    <h4>Product Manager:</h4>
    <p>A Product Manager deals with leading the business process of planning, developing, launching, and managing a product or service. This includes the whole lifecycle of a product, from ideation to development to go and be available in the market.<br><u>Suitability:</u> I feel like I could be a Product Manager since I do like leading the process to develop, plan, launch, and manage a product or service, but some challeneges I expect to encounter is maybe the first idea won't always work, so I should be prepared to use a different idea and be open to new suggestions to improve the product or service.</p>
    <h4>Release Engineer: </h4>
    <p>A Release Engineer works with software development engineers to state all the steps needed to release the software. Starting from how the software is stored in the source code repository, to build rules for compilation, to how testing, packagaing, and deployment are conducted in order to make the software a finished product.<br><u>Suitability:</u> I feel like I could be a Release Engineer since I do like helping release new software and I could help with testing, packaging, and deploying the softwaare to a finished product, but some challeneges I expect to encounter is the product might not be completly ready when I check it before releasing it, so there would need to be additional changes to the software before releasing it to a new product or service.</p>

    <h2><b>Week 2: 9-Jan-2023</b></h2>
    <h3><u>Technical Challenges:</u></h3>
    <p>My team has only faced the technical challenege of switching browsers because Google Chrome has been having minor issues with CoderMerlin. This challenege can easily be solved with a simple solution. We intend to overcome that challenege by switching over to FireFox, so our code for our project will work smoothly with no unexpected issues.</p>
    <h3><u>Scheduling Challenges:</u></h3>
    <p>My team has only faced a scheduling challenge when one of our team members were absent for a day. This challenge can easily be solved with a simple solution. We intend to overcome that challenge by communicating with our team members to let them know any new information, updates, or issues that need to be resolved.</p>
    <h3><u>Interpersonal Challenges:</u></h3>
    <p>My team has not faced any interpersonal challenges. If a interpersonal challenge(s) is to come up, then my team will come up with a plan and implement it into immediate effect when it's needed. Also, I don't think we shall have any interpersonal challenges, since everyone seems to be just fine with the way they are in the team which will probably lead to no interpersonal challenges within the team.</p>
