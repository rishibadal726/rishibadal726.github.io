    <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
    <p>I assisted: No one</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p>The general process for executing addition, regardless of base is by aligning the digits vertically, then add the right-most column and if the number is greater than the quantity represented by a ingle digit, then we carry the number and move to the left and keep repeating till you get your answer.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>Special factors that need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers is that you should always remember the base is 8 and make sure your answer doesn't have a number that is 8 or greater because the base is 8.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>3.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p>Special factors that need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers is that you should always remember the base is 8 and make sure your answer doesn't have a letter that goes beyond the letter, F, and it doesn't go over the number of 9.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>Special factors that need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers is that you should always remember the base is 2 and make sure your answer doesn't have a number that is 2 or greater because the base is 2.</p>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that addition with different number systems is important. The "big idea" is that we learned how to do addition with different number systems.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I was adding the numbers.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by doing more practice and reading carefully.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that there are different ways to add with different number systems.</p>
