    <h1>CS-I Journal J1152: While Loop</h1>

    <p>I assisted: No one</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Why is the test executed prior to the loop?</h3>
    <p>This test is executed prior to the loop because it needs to check the condition and see if the loop shall run or if it will be jumped over.</p>
    <h3>1.2: Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h3>
    <p>Similarities: if the condition is always true it keeps running, but if the condition is false then it will not run the code that is associated with the loop. Differences: This diagram has a test section and there are different alternatives based on the inputs. </p>
    <h3>1.3: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent is to jump back to the condition to run it again in the loop.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned what while loops are and how they work with conditionals and Jump instructions. The "big idea" is that while loops are always tested by a condition to see if it's true or false and to see if the code in the while loop will run or not.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I didn't encounter any challenges.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by adding more examples of how these while loops would help us complete a task.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>What I've learned has affected my thinking because it has showed me how while loops work, and it has helped me to think like a computer.</p>
