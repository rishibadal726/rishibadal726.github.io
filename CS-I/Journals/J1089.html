    <h1>CS-I Journal J1089: Hello World</h1>
    <p>Name: Rishi Badal</p>
    <p>Date: 19-Jan-2023</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
    <p>I assisted: No one</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Why do you think Hello world is typically the first program taught to students?</h3>
    <p>The Hello World program is first taught to students because it is easy to understand and demonstrates how a specific programming language inputs/outputs things.</p>
    <h3>1.2: How might the Hello World program be different, depending on the programming language it's written in?</h3>
    <p>The Hello World program might be different because when it's in a different programming language there is a different type of syntax which can change the way of how you do a Hello World program.</p>
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that the Hello World program is usually the first thing that students learn in programming. The "big idea" is that the Hello World program can show us how a programming language inputs/outputs things.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I didn't encounter any challenges.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved if there was some sample code for different languages on how to print the Hello World program in different programming languages.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>From what I've learned it has affected my thinking because I realized that the Hello World program demonstrates how a certain programming language's can do the Hello World program which can also teach us the syntax too.</p>
