    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
    <p>The truth table that produces the output of the Carry column is the "AND" truth table.</p>
    <h3>1.2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
    <p>The truth table that produces the output of the Sum column is the "XOR" truth table.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
    <p>The relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder compared to all of the rows of the half-adder is that both of them use the same inputs and outputs.</p>
    <h3>2.2: Why is this true?(Relating to the previous question 2.1)</h3>
    <p>It is true because both of the tables use the same inputs, which leads to the same result for both of them.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
    <p>The least significant bit position uses a half-adder rather than a full-adder is becuase a full-adder can only be used with two single-bit binary integers plus a carry.</p>
    <h3>3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>The correct output from S will be available instantaneously because of all the proper inputs that are applied for all bits in numbers A and B.</p>
    <h3>3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
    <p>We can infer that the non-scientific calculator used a ripple carry-adder, allowing it to produce the high output. This state is commonly called cascading adders.</p>
    

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that there are different types of adders to add different bits such as a half-adder(capable of adding 2 bits), full-adder(capable of adding 3 bits), and ripple-carry adder(capable of adding 4 or more bits).</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I tried to interpret the diagrams.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by looking closely at how the inputs went into the speific adders on the diagrams.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that bits can be added through different adders such as the half-adder(adds two bits), full-adder(adds three bits), and a ripple-carry-adder(adds four or more bits).</p>
