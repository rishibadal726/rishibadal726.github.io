    <p>I assisted: No one</p>


    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model</h3>
    <p> Two other services I use which is implemented using a Client/Server Model is when texting and tiktok.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
   <p> I think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important because it can create more subdirectories and help navigate to more specific files that you want to open.</p> 

   <h2>Section 3</h2>
   <h3>3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
   <p>The home directory has the tilde(~) because it can help users indicate where the home directory is.</p>

   <h2>Section 4</h2>
   <h3>4.1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
   <p>Yes the prompt did change into a different directory by using the cd command. This is useful because you might need to switch to a different directory.</p>

   <h2>Section 5</h2>
   <h3>5.1: What happens each time you press the ↑?</h3>
   <p> When I press the up-arrow it shows the previous command I used.</p>

   <h3>5.2: What happens each time you press the ↓?</h3>
   <p> When I press the down-arrow it shows the most recent command I used.</p>

   <h2>Section 6</h2>
   <h3>6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
   <p>"Hello, World!" was printed to the screen before. I think think when I typed the command it printed the text inside the quotation marks. </p>

   <h2>Section 7</h2>
   <h3>7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
   <p> The ls command shows all the files in a specific directory your in. The tree command shows a tree showing the roots of files and subdirectories.</p>

   <h3>7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
   <p> If you want to see the subdirectories and where files are then use the tree command. If you want to see the files in a specific directory then use the ls command.</p>

   <h2>Section 8</h2>
   <h3>8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
   <p>The sleep command specifies that it will pause a job for a certain amount of time.</p>

   <h3>8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
   <p>Yes I can prove it because it says the sleep command will wait before returning to do the job for a command.</p>

   <h2>Section 9</h2>
   <h3>9.1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
   <p>It wasn't different then what I expected it to do.</p>

   <h3>9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
   <p>To run a job in the background means that you will run a current job right now and leave another job running in the background while the current job will be running.</p>
 
   <h3>9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
   <p>The number displayed in the brackets specifies the job that is being paused.</p>

   <h2>Section 10</h2>
   <h3>10.1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
   <p> I observed that it shows which jobs are being paused by the sleep command.</p>

   <h3>10.2: How do you explain your observations?</h3>
    <p>It's because the job was paused and I couln't access it until the time limit expired.</p>

   <h2> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
   <p>I learned how to use the shell and new commands to help me. The "big idea" is learning the basics of shell.</p>


    <h2> What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p> I encountered challenges in figuring out how the jobs worked.</p>


   <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
   <p>The experience coulld be improved if I had read the reading more carefully.</p>


   <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
   <p>It affected my thinking by letting me get exposed to the basics of shell and how to use the shell and new commands to use</p>
