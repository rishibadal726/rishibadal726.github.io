    <h1>Input, Output, and an Inverter</h1>
    <h2>1. Click on the leftmost (input) H in the top diagram which simply represents a wire.</h2>
    <h3>1.1 What happens to the H?</h3>
    <p>The H switches to an L.</p>
    <h3>1.2 Does the color of the wire change?</h3>
    <p>Yes because the wire changes into a gray color.</p>
    <h3>1.3 How is the output impacted?</h3>
    <p>The output becomes a low voltage instead of a high voltage because of the input.</p>
    <h2>2. Click on the leftmost (input) H in the bottom diagram which represents an inverter.</h2>
    <h3>2.1 What happens to the H?</h3>
    <p>The H switches to an L.</p>
    <h3>2.2 Does the color of the wire change?</h3>
    <p>Yes because only the part before the inverter switched to a green color.</p>
    <h3>2.3 How is the output impacted?</h3>
    <p>The output becomes a high voltage instead of a low voltage because of the input and inverter.</p>

    <h1>AND Gate</h1>
    <h2>3. Click on the top L input.</h2>
    <h3>3.1 What happens to the top L?</h3>
    <p>The top L switched to an H.</p>
    <h3>3.2 What happens to the output?</h3>
    <p>The output stays as L because of the input.</p>
    <h2>4. Click on the bottom L input</h2>
    <h3>4.1 What happens to the bottom L?</h3>
    <p>The bottom L switched to an H.</p>
    <h3>4.2 What happens to the output?</h3>
    <p>The output stays as L beause of the input.</p>
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that the difference between circuits in logic composition. The "big idea" is that different circuits have different outcomes based on the inputs and what kind of gate it is.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I tried to build the circuits on the website, but eventually I found out how to make the circuits.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by focusing more on how to make the circuits on the website.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that circuits can be rearranged in different ways for different circuits to have different functions based on its logic compositon.</p>
