    <h1>CS-I Journal J1006: Source Control</h1>
    <p>Name: Rishi Badal</p>
    <p>Date: 29-Aug-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
    <p>I assisted: No one</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: What is Git communicating to you?</h3>
    <p>Git is communicating to me that the commit id is there and who the author is and when the commit was made with the description of the git</p>

    <h3>1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <p>Similar things between the git log command and the git commit command are that they both show that you commited and they show the description of the git. </p>

    <h3>1.3: Why do you think this is?</h3>
    <p>This is because it helps you see the description of the git and understand what it is to you.</p>
      
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>I noticed that file1.txt has been modified and is being tracked while file2.txt is untracked and not committed yet.In git status they are displayed as the file1.txt is modified and can be restored to discard changes in working directory and the file2.txt is an untracked file and still needs to be committed to be tracked. </p>
    
    <h3>2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>No they aren't displayed in the same setion because file1.txt has been committed while file2.txt has not been committed to git.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>I noticed that file1.txt is still in its modified stage while now the file2.txt is in its new file stage for git and that's how they are displayed too.</p>

    <h3>3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>file1.txt is displayed in a manner of modified file status while file2.txt is displayed in a manner of a new file status.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <p>3 files are being listed of having a change.</p>

    <h3>4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>The specific differences listed in each file are the description and status of each file.Green color shows the description of the git for the specific file. Blue color shows the addedgit to a specific file. </p>

    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>5.1: What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>Git tells me that file1.txt has 1 additional and removed change and file2.txt has no changes.</p>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that source control can help us retrieve different versions of our work such as previous versions of our work. The "big idea" is that previous versions can be recovered through source control.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when trying to understand the status of the git</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by looking over the aspects of the status of the git.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that previous versions of my work can be recovered if I made a mistake or I just need it for some reason and to do that I just use source control to help me out with that.</p>
