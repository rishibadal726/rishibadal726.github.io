    <h1>CS-I Journal J1013: Boolean Algebra</h1>
    <p>Name: Rishi Badal</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
    <p>I assisted: No one</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction â‰ ?</h3>
    <p>That is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction because it shows that if the output is true if either of the inputs are true but both are not true. </p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</h3>
    <p>The formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to number of inputs because on the left-hand side of the table we enemurate the input(s) and on the right-hand side of the table we specify the output(s) based on the number of input(s) which will then be used for the formula. The formula is 2^n because when there is a single input, we can formalize the relationship with the formula. </p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that there are different operations in boolean algebra. The "big idea" is about the different basic and secondary operations and how to use them with truth tables and for problems.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I tried to get the output of the input.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by looking closely at the process of canonical representation.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that boolean algebra will help us learn new operations and help us use them.</p>
