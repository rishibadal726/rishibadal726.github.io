    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</h3>
    <p>Branching enables significantly more complex program behavior because it allows for conditions to be tested to determine the next step without interfering with the rest of the program.</p>
    <h3>1.2: Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true?</h3>
    <p>The term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true because it goes in a consequent pattern.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1: Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?</h3>
    <p>The first Jump instruction is conditional because the program checks if the conditions are met to the consequent code. Flags will determine whether a jump will be executed or not.</p>
    <h3>2.2: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent is that it's to skip the alternative.</p>
    <h3>Why is there no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative?</h3>
    <p>There is no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative because there is no more conditions to execute for the program.</p>
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that a Jump instruction is used to inform the CPU to go directly to another address, skipping any intervening instructions.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I didn't encounter any challenges.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by adding more sample flow charts that demonstrate real world things.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>What I've learned has affected my thinking because it shows me a different perspective on how different tasks work in programming.</p>
